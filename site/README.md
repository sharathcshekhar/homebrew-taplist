# Keg level graphics

This file is a demo of the html page which gets data from your WebApp (described in https://github.com/sharathcshekhar/homebrew-taplist/tree/master/webapp) and
displays a graphic of your Kegleve.
You can try this by plugging in the variables (the URL of you App Script WebApp and access_key).

Check out https://sites.google.com/view/sharath-taplist/home for a demo on how to build a simple digital taplist.
